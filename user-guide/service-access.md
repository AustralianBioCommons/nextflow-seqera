## Access an organisation workspace

Accessing an organisation workspace requires joining the [pilot project of the Australian Nextflow Seqera Service](/main/nextflowseqera/join_us.md).

Under the pilot project, you can:

1. Create workspaces for your community.

2. Contact BioCommons to arrange a new workspace for your organisation/group.

3. Login to the Australian Nextflow Seqera Service and share your email with BioCommons.

4. BioCommons will create a workspace for you and add you as an administrator to the workspace.

5. You can add other users to your workspace by following the instructions at below.

## Join an existing organisation workspace

1. The user who needs to access a workspace should log in to the Australian Nextflow Seqera Service. 

2. The email address used in the userâ€™s login should then be shared with the workspace administrator, and the admin can add the user directly as described in the [Seqera documentation](https://docs.seqera.io/platform/23.4.0/administration/overview#membership-administration). This should be done under the participants' tab in the workspace rather than the organisation.

## Managing participants' access to organisation workspace

Visit the [Seqera documentation](https://docs.seqera.io/platform/23.4.0/administration/overview#workspace-administration) to learn more about different access roles that can be assigned to workspace participants. This will allow for better management of resources and minimise risks. 


## Access a personal workspace

By default, each user on the Australian  Nextflow Seqera Service will have their own personal workspace which can be accessed directly after logging into the service. There is no need to contact the Australian BioCommons to use your own personal workspace. This model is not currently supported, and users are responsible to configure and use their personal workspace.
