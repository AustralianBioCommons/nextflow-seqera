The Australian Nextflow Seqera Service Operational Partners are committed to protecting your privacy. We do not collect, process, retain or share personal data other than for the purposes described below.

# Usage data

- In order to monitor and enhance the Service, we track and retain information about your interaction with the Service (i.e. IP addresses, cookies, pages visited, tool invocation parameters, etc).
- When you run a pipeline on a compute environment, the operators of that compute environment may track your usage in accordance with their terms of service.
- The Operational Partners may share log files of your interactions with the service.
- For promotional reasons, the Operational Partners periodically create public usage reports. When we do, we aggregate and anonymise this data to protect your privacy.

# Registration data

- When you register an account with the Australian Nextflow Seqera Service, we collect registration data (i.e. email address, institutional affiliation and public name).
- The Operational Partners may contact registered account holders using the email address they provide for operational reasons, including: 
    - checking user account security,
    - communicating service downtime, 
    - communicating service improvements,
    - responding to your support requests,
    - surveying existing and planned use in order to improve and promote the service,
    - discussing breaches of these Terms of Use, and
    - communicating updates to the Australian Nextflow Seqera Service policies.

- The Operational Partners may contact registered account holders using the email address they provide for promotional reasons, such as seeking consent and content for newsletters, annual reports or media releases by operational partners and funding partners.

# Credentials

- You can configure workspace credentials to store the access keys and tokens for your compute environments and Git hosting services. These credentials may be transmitted to those services.
