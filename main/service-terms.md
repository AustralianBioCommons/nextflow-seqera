# Definitions

## Operational Partners

[Australian BioCommons](https://www.biocommons.org.au/) (whose lead agent is the University of Melbourne) operates the Australian Nextflow Seqera Service in collaboration with [Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre](https://pawsey.org.au/), [National Computational Infrastructure (NCI)](https://nci.org.au/), and [Seqera](https://seqera.io/). The Service was established as an output of the Australian BioCommons [Bring Your Own Data Expansion Project](https://www.biocommons.org.au/byo-data-platform-expansion) and is hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS). It is supported by [Bioplatforms Australia](https://www.bioplatforms.com/) via [NCRIS funding](https://www.education.gov.au/ncris).

## Australian Research Organisation

For the purposes of these terms of service, an Australian Research Organisation is defined as: A research group within a recognised Australian academic or research institute, or a research consortium receiving Australian research funding.

# Terms of service

Registering with the Australian Nextflow Seqera Service [https://seqera.services.biocommons.org.au](https://seqera.services.biocommons.org.au) denotes agreement with the following terms:

## General Terms

- The Australian Nextflow Seqera Service is only accessible to Australian researchers with an email address affiliated with any Australian research institute. 
- Commercial use of the service without a pre-written agreement is prohibited. For commercial use of the service, contact us at <seqera@biocommons.org.au>.
- Ongoing access is provided under the condition that you abide by the [Acceptable Use Policy](/nextflow-seqera/main/acceptable-use).
- The service collects personal information about you and your use of the service. You consent to use this information for the purposes described in the [Privacy Policy and Data Collection Statement](/nextflow-seqera/main/privacy).
- You agree to indemnify and hold the [Operational Partners](#operational-partners) harmless against all losses related to your use of the service. 
- You agree to acknowledge the use of Australian Nextflow Seqera Service in your research outputs using the format described in the [Acknowledgement Statement](/nextflow-seqera/main/acknowledgement).


## Accessing the service

There are three modes of access to the platform. These are differentiated by the number of users in a workspace, the functionality of the workspace, and the scale of use of the platform. 

### Access mode 1: Individual researcher

- If you are an Australian researcher you can register to access a [private workspace](https://help.tower.nf/latest/core-concepts/definitions/#workspaces) where you can configure and launch pipelines on your self-configured compute environments.
- Australian BioCommons fully subsidises access to private workspaces.

### Access mode 2: Small-scale research organisation

- You can request the creation of a single [organisation workspace](https://docs.seqera.io/platform/latest/orgs-and-teams/workspace-management) to (a) explore and evaluate the platform and features of organisation workspaces, or (b) run small-scale production workloads.
- This mode is **limited to a maximum of three users from the same organisation on the platform**.
- Any users that you add to an organisational workspace must be registered account holders with the Australian Nextflow Seqera Service and abide by these terms and policies.
- Australian BioCommons fully subsidises access for small-scale research organisations.
- If a small-scale research organisation has more than three users **after** the first 12-months of using the platform, Seqeraâ€™s licence terms stipulate that this workspace and its users be transferred into a Large-scale Organisation ([Access mode 3](#access-mode-3-large-scale-research-organisation)).
- When a group has been identified to move to access mode 3 (large-scale use of the service), the group will have a three-month notification period to make their decision on whether they want to move to production use of the service or opt-out without any costs.

### Access mode 3: Large-scale research organisation

- You can request the creation of a new "[organisation](https://docs.seqera.io/platform/latest/orgs-and-teams/organizations)" on the platform.
- This mode allows the first year of use for service exploration and utilisation without any cost.
- **One year after onboarding, the usage of the service by a large-scale research organisation incurs an annual licence fee that needs to be paid by the organisation**.
- We will provide a three-month notification period before the annual fee is applied.
- Under the organisation, you can create an unlimited number of [organisation workspaces](https://docs.seqera.io/platform/latest/orgs-and-teams/workspace-management) (private or shared) that contain all features available on the platform.
- There is no limit on the number of users.
- Permissions and other resource configurations can be set by organisation administrators.
- You can add collaborators from different organisations to your workspaces, but you cannot create workspaces exclusively for their own use.
- Any users that you add to an organisational workspace must be registered account holders with the Australian Nextflow Seqera Service and abide by these terms and policies.
- Australian BioCommons subsidises the cost of maintaining and licensing the platform as well as the human resources supporting the platform and its users.
- The organisation can opt out of using the service when needed and the licence will be cancelled, but there is no refund for the remaining time of the licence.


## Privacy and sharing content

- The Australian Nextflow Seqera Service is designed to support reproducible science. By default, your workflows and data are private. However, you can create and share content including datasets, workflows and compute environments.
- Shared content will be retained for the lifetime of the service (see [service lifetime](/nextflow-seqera/main/service-commitments)).
- You can choose to delete your content at any time.
- Downloading and usage of content from the Australian Nextflow Seqera Service does not transfer any intellectual property rights over the content to you.


## Change of Terms

These Terms of Service are subject to change by Australian BioCommons at any time and without notice, other than through posting the updated Terms of Service on the [https://seqera.services.biocommons.org.au/](https://seqera.services.biocommons.org.au/) website and communicating the update to the registered account holders.


## Termination

- Australian BioCommons reserves the right, without notice, at its sole discretion and without liability, to restrict or remove access where it considers that your use of the Australian Nextflow Seqera Service seeks to impede its operations or violates these Terms of Use.
- The users can opt out of using the service at any time they prefer. In case of production service usage, there will be no refund for the remaining time of the licence.
