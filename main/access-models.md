# Access models for the service

There are currently two ways in which you can make use of the Australian Nextflow Seqera Service:

## 1. Organisation workspace

A collaborative workspace where multiple users can collaborate and share resources such as compute environments and workflows. More details are available via the [Seqera documentation at this link](https://docs.seqera.io/platform/latest/orgs-and-teams/workspace-management/). 

The Australian BioCommons supports this model by providing advice and expertise that facilitates onboarding and use of organisation workspaces. 

Note: 

- Each community is responsible for the long-term management and maintenance of its workspaces.
Organisation workspaces are private and their resources are only accessible by the workspace users and the Owners of the Australian BioCommons Organisation.

- Organisation workspace can be shared where all their resources become accessible to all users in the Australian BioCommons Organisation on Australian Nextflow Seqera platform. This kind of workspace can be very effective to share pipelines to benefit the broader Bioinformatics community. Check Seqera documentation to undestand more about [shared worksapces](https://docs.seqera.io/platform/latest/orgs-and-teams/shared-workspaces/).

> **Important:**
> Please reach out to the Australian BioCommons if you plan to utilise this kind of workspace.

> **Organisaion workspace Support:**
> Check out the [support page](/main/support.md) to undestand more on the available support for this access model.


## 2. Personal workspace
Any Australian researcher can access [the Australian BioCommons Nextflow Seqera Service](http://seqera.services.biocommons.org.au/) and use their own personal workspace. Please refer to the [Seqera documentation](https://docs.seqera.io/platform/latest/getting-started/workspace/). 

Note:

- Personal workspaces are only accessible by their owners.

- The Australian BioCommons does not provide direct support for this model.

- Users are responsible for setting up, managing and maintaining their workspaces. 

> **Important:**
> To access a personal workspace visit the [accessing the service section](/user-guide/service-access.md).
