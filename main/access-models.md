There are three ways in which you can make use of the Australian Nextflow Seqera Service. 
These terms of these models are described in the [Terms of Service](/main/nextflow-seqera/service-terms.md).


## 1. Personal workspace
Any Australian researcher can access [the Australian BioCommons Nextflow Seqera Service](http://seqera.services.biocommons.org.au/) and use their own personal workspace. Please refer to the [Seqera documentation for help getting started](https://docs.seqera.io/platform/latest/getting-started/workspace/). 

Note:

- By default, each user on the Australian Nextflow Seqera Service will have their own personal workspace which can be accessed directly after logging in. There is no need to contact us to use your own personal workspace.

- Personal workspaces are only accessible by their owners.

- Australian BioCommons does not provide direct support for this model.

- Users are responsible for setting up, managing and maintaining their workspaces. 

> **Important:**
> To access a personal workspace visit the [accessing the service section of the user guide](/nextflow-seqera/user-guide/service-access.md).


## 2. Organisation workspace

A collaborative workspace where multiple users can work together and share resources such as compute environments and workflows. More details are available in the [Seqera documentation](https://docs.seqera.io/platform/latest/orgs-and-teams/workspace-management/). 

Australian BioCommons supports this model by providing advice and expertise that facilitates onboarding and use of organisation workspaces. 

Note: 

- This model is limited to a maximum of three users from the same organisation. 

- Each group is responsible for the long-term management and maintenance of its workspaces.
Organisation workspaces are private and their resources are only accessible by the workspace users and the owners of the Australian BioCommons organisation.

- Organisation workspaces can be shared where all their resources become accessible to all users in the Australian BioCommons organisation on the Australian Nextflow Seqera Service. This kind of workspace can be very effective to share pipelines to benefit the broader bioinformatics community. Check Seqera documentation to undestand more about [shared workspaces](https://docs.seqera.io/platform/latest/orgs-and-teams/shared-workspaces/).

> **Important:**
> Please reach out to Australian BioCommons if you plan to utilise this kind of workspace: <seqera@biocommons.org.au>

## 3. New Organisation

You can request the creation of a new "[organisation](https://docs.seqera.io/platform/latest/orgs-and-teams/organizations)" on the platform. The organisation will be only accessible to its users. 

- Under the organisation, you can create an unlimited number of [organisation workspaces](https://docs.seqera.io/platform/latest/orgs-and-teams/workspace-management) (private or shared) that contain all features available on the platform.
- There is no limit on the number of users.

> **Important:**
> This mode allows the first year of use for service exploration and utilisation without any cost.

> **One year after onboarding, the usage of the service by a large-scale research organisation incurs an annual licence fee that needs to be paid by the organisation**.

> **Important:**
> Please reach out to Australian BioCommons if you plan to create a new organisation: <seqera@biocommons.org.au>
