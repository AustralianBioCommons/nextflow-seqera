If you would like to register your interest to participate in the pilot project and explore the community workspace, please familiarise yourself with the prerequisites checklist below and complete this [**expression of interest registration form**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScVFzZXYyFf-3oRaNp4674R1001hp3M0F673tr6zGM6wHsgFA/viewform?usp=sf_link) and a member of the project team will be in contact with you to discuss this further. Otherwise, you can access a personal workspace by login into the service at this [link](https://seqera.services.biocommons.org.au). Personal workspaces are not supported by the Australian BioCommons at this stage.  

## Prerequisite list

1. **Access to compute infrastructure**

    The community/organisation should have access to at least one compute infrastructure that will be configured on the Australian Nextflow Seqera service. There are several supported platforms on Seqera and you can find them [here](https://docs.seqera.io/platform/latest/compute-envs/overview).

2. **Nextflow pipelines**

    The community/organisation should have Nextflow pipelines implemented and tested on the compute environments (from 1). Internally implemented pipelines, those reused from nf-core or any other resources are ok.
    Preferable: Implementation of config profiles that allows conda and docker executions for portability purposes.

3. **Testing datasets**

    For any pipeline, there should be testing datasets available during the deployment on the Australian Nextflow Seqera Service. This should include both small datasets for quick testing and real datasets for production testing.

4. **Nextflow expertise**

    The deployment and configuration of compute environments and pipelines should be led and driven by the community/organisation.  This requires the communityorganisation to have dedicated resources with technical expertise in Nextflow, and infrastructure expertise, including HPC and commercial cloud (depending on the case).

    The dedicated resource with relevant expertise might need to do the following:

    - Implement changes to the pipeline (usually edits to the configuration profiles).
    - Configure, test and debug the pipelines on the community infrastructures.
    - Understand the available computational resources they access.
    - Might require admin access to the compute infrastructure.
    - Manage user access to the community/organisation workspace.

    The BioCommons will provide all possible support with respect to the available resources.
